    <p>  <br>This website exists to support anyone working within, or looking to get involved with, any form of postgrowth movement.  You probably don't need me to explain why the postgrowth/degrowth movement is needed (and if you don't, you can  learn more about Degrowth specifically here ) - but maybe you're unsure about getting help.  The PostGrowth community exists to help support those people looking to thrive in a post-growth world. It is about not being afraid to ask for help if you need it - and offering help to others freely, without any kind of expectations. PostGrowth.co is about offering a reciprocal exchange with like-minded people - those that understand the damage a capitalist, colonialist and extractive, growth-obsessed world has been doing over the past few hundred years. With the range of skills and values our growing community have collectively, we can help you to succeed with your postgrowth business or way of living. </p>  <p> Our Current PostGrowth Collective </p>  <p>These are the amazing people who currently make up our postgrowth/degrowth collective (note: we are always  accepting new members! )</p>  <p>Marketing strategy consultant, & copywriter</p>  <p>Copy editor and proofreader</p>  <p>SEO consultant</p>  <p>Marketing translator & content writer</p>  <p>Product consultant</p>  <p>SEO consultant</p>  <p>Consultant</p>  <p>Creative director, web designer and developer</p>  <p>Sustainability & Communications Manager</p>  <p>Strategist & Researcher</p>  <p> What kind of support can you expect to receive from our community?  <br>   <br>The great thing about a community like ours is that our skills are often changing - new people are joining the collective on a regular basis, meaning the available skills we have are constantly expanding. Whilst we don't want people just to join to get help - we want to attract people who want to give, not just receive - you might be curious to understand how we can help you with your postgrowth ambitions. Ultimately if you're anything like us, you want to find a way of living and working in which you:  <br> Aren't hurting or damaging the environment (living within planetary boundaries)  <br> Aren't exploiting or harming any individuals (good living standards of society)  <br> Aren't producing or selling goods/services which are harmful to the greater society.  <br> Feel that you are providing an important and valuable service.  <br> Are able to meet your basic living requirements, eg covering any bills, enough to pay for food, hopefully with something leftover :)  </p>  <p> Our Current Skills (which are always changing!)  <br>   <br>You might think of us as amplifiers of all the good work you are doing - we can help ensure your message hits the right people, in the right way, at the right time.   Here are a list of skills and services we currently have available between the members of our collective:  <br> Website platform setup and management (eg Wordpress or other custom software)  <br> Social media consultancy  <br> Content strategy  <br> Marketing consultancy  <br> Digital marketing & SEO support  <br> Translation services  <br> Copywriting services    <br> If you need a particular skill/service that isn't listed above then don't worry - we still think you should join - you never know if we can help direct you to someone who can help. Why are a bunch of strangers willing to give up some of their valuable time to help another stranger succeed with their postgrowth ambitions? Simple really - we all think this is super-important work, as it is the  only  way we can raise living standards for all whilst having a viable future on this planet ⭐  NOTE: We'd love to add more consultants and specialists across a range of fields to our postgrowth collective. It's completely free and always will be. You can apply to  join the collective here .  ⭐    </p>  <p>   <br>If you are operating within the degrowth, postgrowth, buenvivir or another alternative economy space, or have aims to, then why not join our collective today!</p>  <p>Join our collective <br>https://postgrowth.co/volunteer/</p>
