    <p>  <br>If you are operating within the degrowth, postgrowth, buenvivir or another alternative economy space then feel free to complete the form below or send me a message. Labels aren't that important here - I appreciate some people might be working on things which  could  be categorised as degrowth, but might not be conscious of the degrowth/postgrowth movement. So, don't worry too much about whether you think you might/might not belong to the movement, I will use some common sense when reviewing any applications for help 🙂 Fill in the form below and someone will be in touch to arrange a short informal chat to see how we can support you.  </p>  <p> Form to apply for free assistance  <br>Form which asks people to share their name, email and website and asks them how they require support for their degrowth project. <br>Form to apply for free assistance <br>   <br>Having problems completing the above form?
