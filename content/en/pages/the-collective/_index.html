    <p>A brief summary of the PostGrowth collective</p>
  body: >-
    <p>What is the PostGrowth Collective?  <br>   <br>It is a group of people who have come together because they believe that we need to be shifting towards a post-growth way of living. This means moving away from our obsession with growing GDP (in countries where more growth isn't required - basic needs are being met) and finding a way to operate in a world where constant growth isn't the objective. Our collective is made up of a range of people, all with various skills, who are looking to help each other whilst contributing to a larger post-growth or degrowth movement.</p>  <p> How does the Collective Operate?  <br>   <br>So far, there is no strict structure or routine, and importantly anyone who joins the collective isn't forced to participate. We understand that everyone has other commitments (jobs, kids, whatever), so we operate on a casual basis. The rough structure is as follows:  <br>  Somebody will reach out (either internally or externally) to explain the issue they currently have. For example, perhaps they want to start a local degrowth group but they lack the skills/knowledge to setup a website.   <br>  I will send out a notification to the PostGrowth collective, explaining the help request received, and asking anyone who is interested in helping to join a group call.  <br>  On this call, we will hear from the person who put in the help request, and then collectively we will discuss and offer our advice. After the call and going forward someone (or multiple people) from the collective will work with them to help (in this case to setup a website for them), if they need this ongoing assistance.   <br> After the project is completed, or after a few weeks have passed, we will ask the internal collective if anyone wants to be in the 'hotseat' where they might explain  the issue they are having, or the kind of problem they are trying to overcome (relating to something in the postgrowth field, of course).  <br> If someone 'external' has a problem that they think could be solved collaboratively by the group, we urge that they first join our collective to become a part of the movement.  This is to prevent people from asking for help without really feeling obliged to return the favour, encouraging a way of working which would align with postgrowth and degrowth style movements - based on the idea of reciprocity, vs the typical capitalist-aligned, transaction-based method.  It's nice to think that the people who ask for help, will later go on to provide help to other members of the collective.</p>  <p> What are the Requirements for Joining?  <br>   <br>There are none - just that you have to be serious (and genuine) with your intentions towards a postgrowth world. Even if you are beginning on this journey, this is fine, we just want to be mindful about only including people who strongly feel our capitalist, growth obsessed world isn't the only way for our society to operate.
