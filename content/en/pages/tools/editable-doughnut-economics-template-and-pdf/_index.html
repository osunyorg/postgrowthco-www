    <p>  <br>Would you like to create your own Doughnut Economics framework? Maybe you would like to have a go creating your own version based upon Kate Raworth's original framework.</p>  <p>  An  editable Canva template of the Doughnut  <br> A downloadable  PNG template of the Doughnut A  downloadable  PDF template of the Doughnut Economics framework <br>Doughnut Economics PDF Template</p>  <p>A JPG template of the Doughnut</p>  <p>   <br>Doughnut economics template</p>  <p> Ideas for using the above Doughnut Template  <br>   <br>There are lots of cool things you can try with the doughnut - I'm going to have a go seeing if I can create a version with the activity of "Marketing" applied to the framework - seeing if it's possible to carry out such an activity without encroaching upon the ecological ceiling or the social foundation (I won't hold my breath!). You could see how you can apply the work you do within the doughnut framework - not as part of some kind of weird guilt trip, but just to ask some questions. These exercises are great as part of a group workshop for those who are interested in improving society or the environment - which is likely a fairly large group!</p>  <p> Questions or Feedback  <br>   <br>I'm not a graphic designer and the above version of the doughnut was based on the original by Kate Raworth, author of the Doughnut Economics book. If you have any questions, complaints, feedback or requests, please don't hesitate to  contact me .  </p>
