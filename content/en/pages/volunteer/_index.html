    <p>  <br>Everybody is welcome to join the PostGrowth collective - it is free to do so and you're under no obligation to participate.  All we ask is that people join in the spirit of reciprocity - if you are looking to get support with operating in a postgrowth way that's fine, we just ask that you try to give back in some way too :) </p>  <p> Who Can Join the Post Growth Collective?  <br>   <br>Everyone is welcome here - and we particularly want to ensure we have a diverse group of people involved here, as the benefits of a postgrowth world aren't confined by where in the world you are based! We think that everyone has skills that can be useful, but in todays very tech-first society there may be some skills that are in quite high demand. So - the below skills are used just as examples - there are countless ways you can get involved to help people in the postgrowth movement, so even if your expertise doesn't align with any of the below, but you're still keen to join the community, please do so!  <br> Web Designers & Web Developers  <br> Graphic Designers <br>  <br> Videographers <br>  <br> Illustrators <br>  <br> Copywriters <br>  <br> Journalists <br>  <br> Researchers  <br> Editors  <br> Translators <br>  <br> Digital Marketers <br>  <br> Social Media Specialists  <br> Event Planners  <br> Comms Specialists  <br> Because this is an online, remote community, I think it's natural that many of the roles listed above will be fairly remote-friendly. There may be other useful skills that you have - so like we said earlier - you're more than welcome to join us even if you don't relate to any of the above! </p>  <p> How does the Community Function?  <br>   <br>The way that we function is currently as follows. Every few weeks we have a group call, where everyone in the community is welcome to attend (we will use an online meeting tool like Zoom or similar).  One (or two) people will take the floor and describe what kind of help or support they are looking for. They will talk briefly about their business, or idea, and then other members of the group will share their thoughts. Collectively we will figure out what kind of help might be useful, and then we will work together to come up with a plan of supporting and implementing this work. After the call it might be that one or two people follow up with this person, to provide assistance, and to ensure they get the help they need. And then later the whole process is repeated, with another person opting to take up the hotseat and to ask for support. In this format there's many benefits:  <br> Someone gets to promote and discuss their postgrowth business or project  <br> They benefit from having lots of eyes (and brains!) on them, so we have a variety of viewpoints and expertise to tap into.  <br> The people watching get to benefit from hearing the thoughts and advise shared by others - everyone is learning, even if subconsciously.  <br> Money has been taken out of the equation here; this is all a reciprocal engagement based on people helping people.  <br> Later on, the person(s) who benefitted from the help received will be expected to give back, by helping others, when they can. </p>  <p>the best gift is you <br>Photo by  Dakota Corbin  on  Unsplash <br> Am I under any obligations if I join the community?  <br>   <br>Everyone is busy leading their own lives - you might also have your own clients to serve (or a boss) - so any time you can offer to the PostGrowth.co community is always appreciated. It is up to you how much time you give here - this is for you to decide.  Sometimes you might have a few hours to give per week, others you might have nothing... and that's ok!  </p>  <p>the best gift is you <br>Photo by  Dakota Corbin  on  Unsplash <br> Join the Community!  <br> Volunteer Application Form  <br>A form asking users to provide their name, email address and a description of the services they are willing to volunteer to support the postgrowth movement. <br>Volunteer Application Form </p>
