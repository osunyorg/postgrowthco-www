biography: >-
  <p>I'm a grassroots educator, social innovator, and founder of DYIP (Design Your Infinite Possibilities), a self-designed learning initiative rooted in rural West Bengal, India. </p><p>With a background in community-driven education, agroecology, and circular economy models, I was drawn to the principles of degrowth through lived experiences of rural resilience and the limitations of extractive development. </p><p>I support PostGrowth by bringing grounded perspectives from the Global South, co-creating alternative pathways for education, livelihoods, and sustainability rooted in local wisdom and regenerative practices.  </p>
