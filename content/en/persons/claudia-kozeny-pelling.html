biography: >-
  <p>I'm a qualified marketing translator and bilingual SEO content writer based in the UK. </p><p>Born and raised in Germany, I've been living in Oxford since the late '90s. </p><p>After a career in publishing and communications, mainly at the University of Oxford, I started freelancing as a translator and SEO content writer in 2020. </p><p>I focus on helping small, purpose-driven brands and fellow freelancers based in the UK/EU with their marketing copy. </p><p>I'm supporting the degrowth movement because it's clear that the current systems don't work for the planet (or the average citizen).
