  <p>I'm an <a href="https://www.dr-smith-editing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">editor <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a> from Ireland, now based in Asturias, Spain. I have over a decade of experience in research and publishing, and offer tailored editing services to a variety of clients. </p><p>My own research has <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=a769KK4AAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">been published <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a> in world-leading journals, so I understand the support needed to take a project to successful completion. </p><p>Degrowth has been at the core of my thinking for years, while also providing a vibrant community of colleagues who also recognise that our fossil fuel-based way of life is on its way out. </p><p>I am passionate about exploring equitable and sufficiency-based ways of living.  </p>
