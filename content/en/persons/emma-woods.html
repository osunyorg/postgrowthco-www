biography: >-
  <p>Emma Woods is a freelancer trying to make economics more accessible. </p><p>Economic thinking has driven us to the point of planetary collapse, yet we're told this is "the best economic system"....really?</p><p> I offer economics education, workshops and community building events to demystify economics and scatter the seeds of alternative economic systems with the aim of pushing back against the dominance, violence and oppression of capitalism.</p>
