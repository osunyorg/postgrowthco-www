biography: >-
  <p>My work is based on over 15 years of corporate and consulting experience in sustainability and social impact and a lifetime of participation in social impact and supporting social justice causes.  I have been leading and supporting sustainability strategy and communications for most of my career. This includes internal and external engagement and sustainability reporting and management.  </p><p>This career history has led me to question why, if we have been working as diligently as we have said we have been, why are all our indicators taking us the wrong way? Why are we moving past 1.5 ℃ despite global commitments?  </p><p>I’ve come to understand that a shift to degrowth, post-growth, well-being, regenerative economic models are the best way to stop and slow human activities that lead to climate change.  My work involves changing business mindsets and creating the tools to help that shift. Telling the stories that help support that shift.  </p>
