biography: >-
  <p>I am George, a UX designer based in the UK. </p><p>I work for a digital agency, <a href="https://serieseight.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Series Eight <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a>, and freelance, mostly designing websites and branding. </p><p>Degrowth has resonated with me for a while, and is something I'd like to get more involved in and contribute to in what way I can. </p><p>More recently, I've been looking into how I can offer services to produce websites that are more eco-friendly and suited to the needs of charities and organisations. </p><p>I've found out more through online communities, such as <a href="https://climateaction.tech/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">ClimateAction.tech <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a>, and seeing what agencies such as <a href="https://www.heylow.world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">HeyLow <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a> are doing has been inspiring. </p><p>Would love to offer my services, get involved and meet like-minded people!</p>
