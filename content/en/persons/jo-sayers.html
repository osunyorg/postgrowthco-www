biography: >-
  <p>Who I am: Jo co-runs the learning agency LearnJam. I used to be a language teacher, and have worked in education, learning design and content development for 20 years. </p><p>What does LearnJam do: We can help individuals and organisations figure out where leaning (and unlearning) are a key part of their offering to customers and users. We help design, test and develop experiences that help people learn (and unlearn) in pursuit of social and environmental change; particularly to move away from Capitalism, white-supremacy and patriarchy. </p><p>How we came to degrowth: As we explored how to use our learning design and educational skills to help address the climate emergency, we slowly came to realise that our economic systems and their focus on power, growth and capital are ultimately responsible for the climate crisis and many other social injustices in the world. </p><p>We love work that helps us slow down, reconnect with land and nature and each other. </p><p>We want to wriggle out of being a part of the problem and sow some seeds of change that help us to organise around connection, abundance, gratitude and reciprocity.  </p>
