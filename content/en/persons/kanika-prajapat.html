biography: >-
  <p>A deeply committed advocate for degrowth and post-growth economics, my background in the climate field has equipped me with critical skills in leadership and project management. </p><p>I'm organized and detail-oriented with the uncanny ability to keep projects on track despite chaos. </p><p>My current mission is to help others understand why a post-growth future isn't just necessary, it's actually pretty exciting. </p><p>I firmly believe that the pursuit of capitalistic growth lies at the heart of our planet's polycrisis, and I'm committed to exploring, articulating, and communicating degrowth pathways to shift to a new way of living. </p><p>I have extensive experience in project and product management, crafting ambitious yet achievable project timelines, managing stakeholders, building product MVPs, and conducting user studies for improving UI/UX.  </p>
