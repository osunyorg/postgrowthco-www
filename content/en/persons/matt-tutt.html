  <p>Matt Tutt works as a <a href="https://matttutt.me/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">digital marketing consultant <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a> primarily for purpose-driven organisations and those people that are trying to "do good" for the environment or society. </p><p>Based in Galicia, Spain, he is a huge fan of postgrowth and degrowth movements. </p><p>He created PostGrowth.co to try and bring other degrowthers together, where we can work as a collective to support other postgrowth movements on a pro-bono basis.  </p><p>He tries to spend as much time as he can supporting other groups in the degrowth, decolonising and delinking spaces, often with website support services.</p><p>He has also started a tech movement called <a href="https://degoogle.online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">DeGoogle <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a> - an attempt to raise awareness of the harms of Big Tech, but also to collectively encourage people to begin the process of "DeGoogling". </p>
