biography: >-
  <p>I'm an independent SEO consultant with over three years of experience helping organisations improve their visibility on search engines through ethical, user-focused strategies. I've worked with non-profits, e-commerce brands, and purpose-led organisations - always with a focus on long-term impact, not short-term wins.<br><br>I believe SEO can be a quiet, powerful force for good - especially when it supports people and projects trying to build a world that isn't centred on profit and growth at all costs. I'm here to offer SEO advice, audits, or support to anyone working in the degrowth or post-growth space.  </p>
