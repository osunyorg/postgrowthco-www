biography: >-
  <p>Based in Pretoria, South Africa. I've long been interested in alternative societies, ways of living, social and ecological justice, and animation. </p><p>My brother and I started Adaptor as a way to bring those together. </p><p>We believe motion design is a powerful tool to help amplify social and ecologically driven organizations + their causes, through creating engaging content, simplifying complex concepts and helping raise awareness. </p><p>I became interested in degrowth and alternative economic systems after reading Less is More and from there became interested in other radical social theories and anti capitalistic movements like social ecology and anarchism.<br>Basically anything that can advance a more egalitarian world.  </p>
