biography: >-
  <p>I help organizations understand complex issues, make sense of the world, and structure their work to better achieve their goals using participatory formats like workshops and games. I advise on processes, tools, and organizational structures, and sometimes assist with implementation.<br><br>My work is based on nearly three decades of experience in software and IT, project management, teaching, and development cooperation. I combine this experience with an entrepreneurial spirit and a strong theoretical foundation in anthropology.<br><br>I strive for a more equal, inclusive, and sustainable world and support informal groups, nonprofits, and startups that share these values.</p>
