    Cities that have adopted the Doughnut Economics framework
  summary: >-
    <p>Lots of cities have begun adopting the Doughnut Economics framework to reduce the negative impact on the environment and citizens living in the area - we've listed some of the cities here.</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>There are a growing number of cities that have adopted the Doughnut Economics framework to balance social needs with the imperative to reduce their impact on the environment.  Amsterdam is one such famous example but other cities are popping up around the world. In this blog post I'm aiming to document each city that is using the Doughnut and will link to external websites where more information can be obtained. Please let me know if you know of other cities that can be added to this list - it will be a continued work in progress. 1 - Amsterdam, the Netherlands Probably one of the most-cited examples of a city in Europe using the Doughnut framework, Amsterdam adopted this framework in April 2020 during the Covid lockdown.There's more information on this at the DEAL website: https://doughnuteconomics.org/stories/amsterdam-city-doughnut This PDF (again from the DEAL website) is well worth checking out: https://doughnuteconomics.org/amsterdam-portrait.pdf</p>
