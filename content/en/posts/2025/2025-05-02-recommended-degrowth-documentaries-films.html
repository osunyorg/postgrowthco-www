    Recommended Degrowth Documentaries & Films
  summary: >-
    <p>There are some great documentaries about degrowth - we've listed some of them here.</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>From my knowledge there aren't as many Degrowth films and documentaries as there perhaps should be, considering the monumental impact the movement could have on how we all choose to live and work as a society. That said - there are  some  - which is positive news! Here are a few of the best Degrowth documentaries that I've seen so far. Sadly, not all are easily accessible online, but hopefully this too will change soon. If you know of any other documentaries that could fall under the degrowth or postgrowth topic (bearing in mind, many movements probably don't associate themselves or are aware of degrowth as a concept) - do feel free to let me know.</p>  <p> 1 - Can 'Degrowth' Save the World?  <br>   <br>This is a light-hearted 30-minute introduction to the topic of degrowth. I love that such a big outlet like the BBC published this - so the hope is it would have introduced many more people to the topic of degrowth - but it was still a fairly light-hearted, gentle look at what is clearly a huge concept. The documentary appeared to be fully filmed within Barcelona which is considered to many as being the home of the degrowth movement. There were many famous degrowth talking heads, from Jason Hickel (author of Less Is More and author of many research papers) to Joan Martinez-Alier, professor of economics and economic history and believed to be one of the founders of the movement. Various projects within Barcelona were featured briefly, including a housing project led by the  Sostre Civic co-op . Produced and filmed by Alvaro Alvarez Ricciardelli, I think this is a great attempt at bringing the degrowth movement closer to the masses by bridging the gap somewhat between the academic, high-level almost scientific discussion of the movement by presenting it in a more visual, human and relatable form. My only criticism here would be that 30 minutes isn't long enough to show the concept in all its glory - and that perhaps it would have been nice to get out of Barcelona just to show that this is a worldwide movement. I think this grassroots, people-based movement idea needs documenting because it is exactly this which can help it to become the movement it needs to be in order to save humanity. Where to watch:  BBC iPlayer (note that from around 07/2025 this will be taken down from the iPlayer).  </p>  <p>Image from BBC Iplayer showing earth - taken from Can Degrowth Save The Planet <br>BBC iPlayer - Can Degrowth Save the World? https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0021tt7 <br> 2 - Outgrow the System  <br>   <br>Outgrow the System is a brilliant Swedish documentary film with a run time of 60 minutes which not only covers degrowth and postgrowth topics but breaks them down into distinct systems or frameworks. The film discussed the Circular Economy, Doughnut Economics (Kate Raworth herself featured quite heavily as another talking head), Steady-State Economy, Regenerative Economy, Commons-Based Economy, Well-Being Economy, Solidarity Economy and the Participatory Economy. There may have been more (or slightly less?!) but those are what I remember seeing. Frustratingly, this documentary isn't yet available for all to see online for free - you will have to arrange a screening if you did want to show it somewhere. I've spoken to the organisers and it's not expensive to do this - it might work out around £1 per viewer - less if you have a big audience. Outgrow the System offers a more serious look at the postgrowth movement and by focusing on specific movements that are taking place around the world I think it helps people to see exactly how degrowth looks like in practise. I think this is essential because humans need to see (and ideally touch, and feel) these things in order to really believe in them. The film was a production of  Teater K . Where to watch:  you will need to  complete this form  which goes to the promoters who are currently arranging viewings of the film - or you need to find someone who is hosting a viewing near you. Why not reach out and try and set up your own viewing? (I attended a local viewing at a degrowth club near me in Spain - there were just a handful of people present and it's not expensive to arrange your own screening like this).    </p>  <p>Outgrow the system</p>  <p>  </p>  <p>Outgrow the system - trailer on Vimeo </p>
